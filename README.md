Threshsig
=========

This is an implementation of Victor Shoup's ["Practical Threshold Signatures"]
(http://www.shoup.net/papers/thsig.pdf). It was originally written as an
undergraduate summer project for [Oceanstore](http://oceanstore.cs.berkeley.edu/) in 2000.

**Warning**: This code is not maintained, does not use modern coding practices, and has no security claims. 

It is only posted as a reference.

A prototype implementation in Python from 2019 is here: https://github.com/oreparaz/shoup
